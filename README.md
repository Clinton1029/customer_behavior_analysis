# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behaviors using a dataset containing demographic, transaction, and behavioral data. The goal is to gain insights into customer spending habits, preferences, and trends.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python** (Data Processing & Analysis)
- 🗂 **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
- 🔢 **NumPy** (Numerical Computations)
- 📊 **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- 🎨 **Seaborn** (Advanced Visualizations)
- 🌍 **GitHub** (Version Control & Documentation)

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- 📝 **Handling Missing Values:** Removed or imputed missing data. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy)*
- 📏 **Data Formatting:** Standardized date formats, numerical values, and categorical labels. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy)*
- 🚨 **Outlier Detection:** Identified and removed extreme values affecting analysis. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)*
- 🏗 **Feature Engineering:** Created new features for better insights, such as customer lifetime value. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy)*

## 📈 Key Insights from Visualizations
### 📌 Trend of Purchase Amounts Based on Previous Purchases
![Trend of Purchase Amounts](path/to/trend_chart.png)
- There is a dense distribution of purchase amounts across various previous purchase counts.
- No clear increasing or decreasing trend, indicating that past purchases may not significantly influence current spending behavior. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### 💰 Previous Purchases vs. Purchase Amount (USD)
![Previous Purchases vs. Amount](path/to/purchases_vs_amount.png)
- The scatter plot suggests that customers with various purchase histories spend within a similar range.
- Purchase amounts are widely distributed across different previous purchase counts, meaning repeat customers don't necessarily spend more. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### 👵🧑 Age vs. Purchase Amount (USD)
![Age vs. Purchase Amount](path/to/age_vs_amount.png)
- Purchase amounts are fairly consistent across different age groups.
- No strong correlation between age and spending behavior. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### 📊 Distribution of Purchase Amounts (USD)
![Purchase Amount Distribution](path/to/amount_distribution.png)
- The histogram shows a relatively uniform distribution of purchase amounts, with higher frequencies near the upper limit.
- Customers tend to make purchases in all price ranges, with some preference toward higher amounts. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### 💳 Payment Methods Used by Customers
![Payment Methods](path/to/payment_methods.png)
- Credit cards are the most commonly used payment method.
- Other methods, such as Venmo, PayPal, and Debit Card, are also widely used but slightly less frequent. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### 👥 Customer Gender Distribution
![Gender Distribution](path/to/gender_distribution.png)
- Male customers outnumber female customers significantly.
- This imbalance may suggest a targeted audience or differences in shopping preferences between genders. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

## 🔮 Next Steps
- 🔍 Conduct customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
- 📈 Implement predictive modeling to forecast customer behavior.
- 📊 Improve data visualization with interactive dashboards.
