Customer Behavior Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behaviors using a dataset containing demographic, transaction, and behavioral data. The goal is to gain insights into customer spending habits, preferences, and trends.
Tools & Technologies Used
•	Python (Data Processing & Analysis)
•	Pandas (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
•	NumPy (Numerical Computations)
•	Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
•	Seaborn (Advanced Visualizations)
•	GitHub (Version Control & Documentation) 
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
•	Handling Missing Values: Removed or imputed missing data. (Tools: Pandas, NumPy)
•	Data Formatting: Standardized date formats, numerical values, and categorical labels. (Tools: Pandas, NumPy)
•	Outlier Detection: Identified and removed extreme values affecting analysis. (Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn) 
•	Feature Engineering: Created new features for better insights, such as customer lifetime value. (Tools: Pandas, NumPy) 
Key Insights from Visualizations
1.	Trend of Purchase Amounts Based on Previous Purchases 
o	There is a dense distribution of purchase amounts across various previous purchase counts.
o	No clear increasing or decreasing trend, indicating that past purchases may not significantly influence current spending behavior. (Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2.	Previous Purchases vs. Purchase Amount (USD) 
o	The scatter plot suggests that customers with various purchase histories spend within a similar range.
o	Purchase amounts are widely distributed across different previous purchase counts, meaning repeat customers don't necessarily spend more. (Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3.	Age vs. Purchase Amount (USD)                                                                                                                                                              
o	Purchase amounts are fairly consistent across different age groups.
o	No strong correlation between age and spending behavior. (Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)
4.	Distribution of Purchase Amounts (USD)  
o	The histogram shows a relatively uniform distribution of purchase amounts, with higher frequencies near the upper limit.
o	Customers tend to make purchases in all price ranges, with some preference toward higher amounts. (Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)
5.	Payment Methods Use d by Customers
o	Credit cards are the most commonly used payment method.
o	Other methods, such as Venmo, PayPal, and Debit Card, are also widely used but slightly less frequent. (Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)
6.	Customer Gender Distribution 
o	Male customers outnumber female customers significantly.
o	This imbalance may suggest a targeted audience or differences in shopping preferences between genders. (Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Next Steps
•	Conduct customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
•	Implement predictive modeling to forecast customer behavior.
•	Improve data visualization with interactive dashboards.
