# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behaviors using a dataset containing demographic, transaction, and behavioral data. The goal is to gain insights into customer spending habits, preferences, and trends.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Processing & Analysis)
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computations)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- **Seaborn** (Advanced Visualizations)
- **GitHub** (Version Control & Documentation)

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Removed or imputed missing data. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy)*
- **Data Formatting:** Standardized date formats, numerical values, and categorical labels. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy)*
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and removed extreme values affecting analysis. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)*
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features for better insights, such as customer lifetime value. *(Tools: Pandas, NumPy)*

## Key Insights from Visualizations
### Trend of Purchase Amounts Based on Previous Purchases
- There is a dense distribution of purchase amounts across various previous purchase counts.
- No clear increasing or decreasing trend, indicating that past purchases may not significantly influence current spending behavior. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### Previous Purchases vs. Purchase Amount (USD)
- The scatter plot suggests that customers with various purchase histories spend within a similar range.
- Purchase amounts are widely distributed across different previous purchase counts, meaning repeat customers don't necessarily spend more. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### Age vs. Purchase Amount (USD)
- Purchase amounts are fairly consistent across different age groups.
- No strong correlation between age and spending behavior. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### Distribution of Purchase Amounts (USD)
- The histogram shows a relatively uniform distribution of purchase amounts, with higher frequencies near the upper limit.
- Customers tend to make purchases in all price ranges, with some preference toward higher amounts. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### Payment Methods Used by Customers
- Credit cards are the most commonly used payment method.
- Other methods, such as Venmo, PayPal, and Debit Card, are also widely used but slightly less frequent. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

### Customer Gender Distribution
- Male customers outnumber female customers significantly.
- This imbalance may suggest a targeted audience or differences in shopping preferences between genders. *(Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn)*

## Next Steps
- Conduct customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
- Implement predictive modeling to forecast customer behavior.
- Improve data visualization with interactive dashboards.
